# AI Introduction

## What is Artificial Intelligenece
<br/>

AI : is a simulation of human intelligence processed by `machines and softwares`

---
## AI Approaches 
<br/>

### there Are 4 approaches

[ 1 ] The cognitive modeling approach `Thinking Humainly`:

    makes the machine think as human so scientists studied anatomy.

[ 2 ] Turning test approach `Acting Humainly`:

    makes the machine act as human For ==> " Alan Turning "
<br/>
<a href="#alan">But who is Alan Turning</a>

<br/>

[ 3 ] Law of thought approach `Thinking rationally`:

    convert any problem into sentence then symbols (x,y) and using logic rules(and,or) to solve it.

Rationally ==> do the right thing

[ 4 ] Rational agent approach `Acting rationally` <span>Will talk about this approach In Section</span>:

    achieve the best expected outcome when there is uncertainty.

## Scientits roles in this field
<br/>

1. Warren, Walter
   - they wanted to know what is human mind made of so they studied anatomy books and they know that human minds is neurons connected in a specific way so they brought vaccum tubes and connected it together<span style="color: red"> but this still a model that still did not be applied</span>

<br/>

2. Marvin Minsky 
   - The first scientist who applied <span style="color: green">vaccum tubes Model</span> and made the first neural network called `SNARC` 

<br/>

3. Mccarthy
    - Held a `conference` for two months and
gathered all the scientists who interested in making
a mind like the human mind in

<br/>

4. Simon,Newell
    - Who made a `logical theory any problem can be solved with logic`

<br/>

5. Arthur 
   - Made a program for `checkers` game 

<br/>

6. <span id="alan">Alan Turning</span>
    - Asks Question: `Can the machine think ?`
    - Answer is `no`
    - Alan asks :`Can it do what we want ?`

## fondation of AI 

<br/>
There are fields that the AI based in Like:

   1.  Computer Science
   2.  Maths
   3.  Statistical
   4.  Sociology
   5.  Anatomy

## What is Agent ?
<br/>
simply it may be anything which senses the environment by sensors and act upon that with help of its actuators

<br/>

## Some Terms related to Agent

### Sensors
- Part which receives input `precept` form the environment
### actuators
- is the part that helps interact with environment

<br/>
<h3><a href="#env">Environment</a></h3>

<br/>

### Precept
-refers to an agent's perceptual input at any given moment
### Sequence of Precept
- is the complete history of everything the agent has everperceived.

### Agent function (control policy function)
- set of condtion-rules based on it the agent can make decision `action`

## Applications of agent in different fields ?
<br/>
Note Agents Apps not 
<br/>

1. Finance ==`EX`==> Trading Agent
2. Robotics ==`EX`==> Robots
3. Games ==`EX`==> Chess
4. Medicine ==`EX`==> Diagnostic Agent
5. The Web ==`EX`==> Search Engines

---
## Performance measure
    An objective criterion ((utility function)) for success of agent's behaviour
