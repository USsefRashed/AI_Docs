# AI Introduction

## What is Artificial Intelligenece
<br/>

AI : is a simulation of human intelligence processed by `machines and softwares`

---
## AI Approaches 
<br/>

### there Are 4 approaches

[ 1 ] The cognitive modeling approach `Thinking Humainly`:

    makes the machine think as human so scientists studied anatomy.

[ 2 ] Turning test approach `Acting Humainly`:

    makes the machine act as human For ==> " Alan Turning "
<br/>
<a href="#alan">But who is Alan Turning</a>

<br/>

[ 3 ] Law of thought approach `Thinking rationally`:

    convert any problem into sentence then symbols (x,y) and using logic rules(and,or) to solve it.

Rationally ==> do the right thing

[ 4 ] Rational agent approach `Acting rationally` <span>Will talk about this approach In Section</span>:

    achieve the best expected outcome when there is uncertainty.

## Scientits roles in this field
<br/>

1. Warren, Walter
   - they wanted to know what is human mind made of so they studied anatomy books and they know that human minds is neurons connected in a specific way so they brought vaccum tubes and connected it together<span style="color: red"> but this still a model that still did not be applied</span>

<br/>

2. Marvin Minsky 
   - The first scientist who applied <span style="color: green">vaccum tubes Model</span> and made the first neural network called `SNARC` 

<br/>

3. Mccarthy
    - Held a `conference` for two months and
gathered all the scientists who interested in making
a mind like the human mind in

<br/>

4. Simon,Newell
    - Who made a `logical theory any problem can be solved with logic`

<br/>

5. Arthur 
   - Made a program for `checkers` game 

<br/>

6. <span id="alan">Alan Turning</span>
    - Asks Question: `Can the machine think ?`
    - Answer is `no`
    - Alan asks :`Can it do what we want ?`
